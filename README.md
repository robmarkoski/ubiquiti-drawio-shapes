## Introduction

Ubiquiti-DrawIO-Shapes is a set of custom shapes for [Draw.io](https://draw.io), created to help homelab enthusiasts, network engineers, and IT professionals design network topologies and rack setups using Ubiquiti equipment. The shapes are designed to be as accurate and detailed as possible to represent the actual devices.

This repository includes individual shape libraries for various equipment types as well as combination files that include all devices.

- All device shapes are set at 86 x 86 pts.
- The rack devices include a special version (`ubiquiti_rack_devices.xml`) and are 160 pts wide with a 16 pt height per 1U.

All devices are current as of 16th May 2024.
